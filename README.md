# Five Challenging Problems

These problems were posted in the r/programming subreddit and I solved them my way with Ruby.  The problems are as follows.
* write three functions that compute the sum of a list of numbers using a for-loop, while-loop and recursion
* write a function that takes two lists and combines them both with alternating elements between the two
* write a function that computes the list of Fibonacci numbers up to 100 numbers
* write a function that will sort a list of non-negative numbers so that they are arranged to make the biggest possible number
* write a program that outputs all of the possibilities to put + or - or nothing between numbers 1,2,...,9 in this order such that the result is always 100.
